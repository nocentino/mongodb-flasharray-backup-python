# Developer Handoff — mongodb-flasharray-backup

You're inheriting this project. This doc is the **lab-setup + requirements** brief: what the tooling does, the
environment it needs (cluster / VMs / storage / Ops Manager / your workstation), and how the pieces fit. Once
your lab matches the requirements here, follow **[GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)** for the click-by-click
install/configure/first-snapshot, and **[docs/AGENT-TESTING.md](docs/AGENT-TESTING.md)** to drive the full test
and certification suites with a Claude agent (the same way the project has been validated so far).

> The GitHub repo is **public** — never commit secrets. All credentials live in `.env` (git-ignored). Hostnames
> like `aen-mongo-01` are lab names, safe to keep; API keys / passwords / tokens are not.

## 1. What this is

A Python toolkit that performs **crash-consistent snapshot backup and point-in-time recovery (PITR)** of
**MongoDB 8.0** — both **sharded clusters** and **standalone replica sets** — using **Pure Storage FlashArray +
Fusion** under **Ops Manager (OM) third-party backup**.

The flow: OM opens a `$backupCursor` on the chosen member (the **primary**) of each replica set; while it's held,
a **FlashArray protection-group snapshot** is taken across all arrays; restore overwrites each volume in place
(sub-second copy-on-write) and WiredTiger crash-recovers. PITR adds a continuous **oplog tailer** (via OM's Oplog
Snapshot API) plus a **replay** step. The deep design is in **[docs/how-it-works.md](docs/how-it-works.md)**.

**Scope (what's certified vs. out of scope):** in-place **self-restore** (source == target) for sharded and RS,
full snapshots only (FlashArray snapshots are always full — no incremental chain). Cross-cluster RS→RS restore
is implemented but not live-validated; sharded-to-different and incremental are out of scope. See
**[tests-docs/Certification-Summary.md](tests-docs/Certification-Summary.md)**.

## 2. Reference lab architecture (what it was validated on)

Adapt the names to your environment — nothing here is hard-coded except the *shape* requirements in §3–§6.

| Component | Validated lab |
|---|---|
| **Sharded cluster** `aen-prod` (default deployment) | **3 data shards** `prod-shard_01/02/03` (each a 3-member replica set) + a dedicated **3-member config replica set** `prod-cfg` + **2 `mongos` routers**, laid out across **4 nodes** `aen-mongo-01..04` (each data node hosts members of several shards; config members on -01/-02/-03; `mongos` on `aen-mongo-01` and `aen-mongo-02`). |
| **Replica set** `aen-rs-01` | 3 members on `aen-mongo-05/06/07` (:27017); dbPath `/u01/data/rs01`. |
| **Storage** | Each node's data mount (`/u01/data`, configurable via `MONGO_DATA_MOUNT`) is an **LVM volume group** (`vg_database`) over **two 3T FlashArray volumes** (multi-PV) — a single direct pRDM is also supported. Arrays in one **Fusion fleet**: `sn1-x90r2-f07-27`, `sn1-x90r2-f06-27`, `sn1-x90r2-f06-33`, `sn1-c60-e12-16`. |
| **Protection groups** | One PG per cluster, named `<cluster>-pg`: `aen-prod-pg` (**8 volumes** — 4 nodes × 2) and `aen-rs-01-pg` (**6 volumes** — 3 nodes × 2). Each holds every node's data volume(s). |
| **Ops Manager** | OM 8.0, one project (group). Both clusters registered for **third-party backup** (`ACTIVE`). |
| **Control machine** | A workstation/VM with Python 3.11+, the OpenSSH client, and SSH key access to every node. This is where the console commands run. |

> A dense **32-data-shard** build of `aen-prod` (33 replica sets × 5 members, ~165 mongods) was validated as a
> **customer-density scale test** (2026-09-08) — it is not the standing shape. The lab was reduced to the
> 3-shard `aen-prod` + 3-member `aen-rs-01` above and re-validated 2026-09-09.

Both deployments live in **one `.env`** (shared infra + `<NAME>__` per-deployment overrides), selected at runtime
with `--deployment <name>`.

## 3. Cluster / VM (node) requirements

Every MongoDB node VM must satisfy:

- [ ] **OS:** Linux with `systemd` (validated on RHEL/Rocky 9). `python3` present (needed on nodes for oplog
      decode) and **`libsnappy.so`** installed (comes in as a dependency of the OM automation agent RPM; verify
      `rpm -q snappy`).
- [ ] **MongoDB 8.0**, managed by the **Ops Manager automation agent** (`mongodb-mms-automation-agent`).
- [ ] **Data mount on FlashArray volume(s).** The mount path is `MONGO_DATA_MOUNT` (default `/data/mongo`; the
      reference lab uses `/u01/data`), with dbPaths under it (e.g. `/u01/data/shard01`, `/u01/data/cfg`,
      `/u01/data/rs01`) and the WiredTiger journal in-place inside dbPath. Both a **single direct pRDM** and
      **multi-PV LVM-over-multipath** (a VG spanning several FlashArray volumes) are live-validated — if you use
      LVM, see the hard requirement below.
- [ ] **HARD REQUIREMENT — one array per node.** All volumes backing a single node must be on the **same**
      FlashArray. FA snapshots are crash-consistent only *per array*; a node whose data spans two arrays cannot be
      snapshotted consistently. Single-volume nodes satisfy this automatically; for LVM, keep every PV of the VG on
      one array.
- [ ] **`mongosh` present** at a known path (all nodes use the same image → same path). The lab path is
      `/var/lib/mongodb-mms-automation/mongosh-linux-x86_64-<ver>/bin/mongosh`. This becomes `MONGOSH_PATH`.
- [ ] **SSH user (`SSH_USER`) in the `mongod` group** on **every** node — including any node added later — so the
      PITR tailer can `scp` the agent-written `640 mongod:mongod` `.oplogs` files. `ssh <SSH_USER>@<node> id`
      must list `mongod`; if not, `sudo usermod -aG mongod <SSH_USER>`.
- [ ] **Firewall:** each mongod/mongos port reachable cluster-wide (the `mongos` routers on `27017`, plus every
      shard and config-server member port your layout uses). A member added on a new port needs that port opened
      (`firewall-cmd --add-port=<p>/tcp --permanent && firewall-cmd --reload`).
- [ ] **Passwordless `sudo` for `SSH_USER`** — **only `restore` needs it** (it stops agents, unmounts
      the data mount, rescans the LUN, remounts). Snapshot / PITR / init-pg / preflight use no sudo. Grant blanket
      `NOPASSWD: ALL` or the scoped `Cmnd_Alias` in
      [GETTING-STARTED.md → Sudo access](GETTING-STARTED.md#sudo-access-on-the-cluster-nodes-restore-only).

---

## 4. Storage (FlashArray + Fusion) requirements

- [ ] Every array holding a node's data volume is enrolled in **one Fusion fleet** (the tool discovers fleet
      members and routes tag/object calls through the gateway).
- [ ] **One protection group per cluster**, named `<cluster>-pg`, containing every node's data volume. Created /
      maintained by **`initialize-protection-groups`** (re-run it after any topology change — it also refreshes the
      copyable `mongo:` volume-map tags the hot path reads).
- [ ] **Credentials:** a FlashArray **directory account** (`FA_USERNAME`/`FA_PASSWORD`) that authorizes on **every**
      fleet member (preferred), or a single-array API token (`FA_APITOKEN`). Plus the **gateway endpoint**
      (`FA_ENDPOINT`) and `FA_API_VERSION`.

---

## 5. Ops Manager requirements

- [ ] **Ops Manager 8.0**, cluster(s) monitored + automated.
- [ ] **Third-party backup enabled** and each cluster **`ACTIVE`**. For a **replica set**, register via the
      third-party `…/clusters/{id}/manage` endpoint — **no OM snapshot store needed**; the managed-backup path
      (`backupConfigs statusName=STARTED`) is wrong here and 409s "no available Snapshot Store". See
      [docs/third-party-backup-reference.md](docs/third-party-backup-reference.md).
- [ ] **An OM API key** (public/private) with role **`GLOBAL_BACKUP_ADMIN`**, and the control machine's IP on the
      key's access list. These become `OM_PUBLIC_KEY` / `OM_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- [ ] Know your **group (project) id** and each **cluster id** → `OM_GROUP_ID`, `OM_CLUSTER_ID` (per deployment),
      plus `OM_BASE_URL` / `OM_API_VERSION`.

> **OM is the fragile dependency.** Topology changes (shard add/remove, config-server conversion) can *wedge*
> third-party backup, and the app server can silently stop. Recovery procedures (force-unmanage → `mongodb-mms`
> restart → `manage`; skip-forward oplog re-baseline) are in the runbook —
> [tests-docs/Certification-Summary.md](tests-docs/Certification-Summary.md) → "Operational runbook" — and
> [docs/LESSONS.md](docs/LESSONS.md).

---

## 6. Control machine (where you run the tools) requirements

- [ ] **Python 3.11+** and the **OpenSSH client** (`ssh`/`scp`).
- [ ] **SSH key-based auth** to every node as `SSH_USER` (no password prompts): `ssh <SSH_USER>@<node> true`.
- [ ] Network reach to **Ops Manager** (`OM_BASE_URL`) and the **FlashArray gateway** (`FA_ENDPOINT`).
- [ ] Clone + install (editable) into a venv — see [GETTING-STARTED.md → Install](GETTING-STARTED.md#1-install).

## 9. Handoff acceptance checklist

You're up and running when all of these pass:

- [ ] `new-mongo-snapshot --help` prints usage (install OK).
- [ ] `.env` filled; `ssh <SSH_USER>@<each-node> sudo -n true` succeeds; `id` lists `mongod`.
- [ ] OM reachable and both clusters report third-party backup **`ACTIVE`**; FA gateway reachable.
- [ ] `initialize-protection-groups --deployment <name>` succeeds and the PG lists every node's volume.
- [ ] `preflight-mongo-backup --deployment <name>` reports all checks **PASS** (exit 0).
- [ ] A **snapshot → mutate → restore** cycle passes with **drift 0** and the sentinel gone
      (Test 4 sharded / Test 6 RS — or just run `demo/rs-restore-demo.sh`).
- [ ] A **PITR cycle** (`start-oplog-tailer` → snapshot → writes → drain → stop → restore → replay) reaches
      **`unrecoveredTail=0`** (Test 5 sharded / Test 7 RS).

For the automated way to prove all of the above — including the full certification matrix — hand
[docs/AGENT-TESTING.md](docs/AGENT-TESTING.md) to a Claude agent.
